<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Vince Karlo Dulay, an aspiring front-end developer with a passion for crafting visually appealing and user-friendly web experiences. My journey into web development started with a fascination for how websites come to life, and I’ve since dedicated myself to learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I enjoy building projects that combine functionality with creativity, and I thrive on the challenge of turning ideas into responsive and engaging interfaces.

<p>As I work toward a career in front-end development, my primary focus is on honing my skills in modern web technologies and frameworks like React and Tailwind CSS. I'm eager to collaborate on projects that help me grow both technically and creatively. I believe that staying curious and adaptable is essential in this ever-evolving field, and I’m committed to learning new tools and best practices that enhance the user experience.</p>

<p>When I’m not immersed in code, you’ll often find me enjoying my other passion—gaming! I love exploring new worlds, solving puzzles, and connecting with others through games. My enthusiasm for gaming has taught me the importance of interactive and immersive design, which I aim to bring into my development work. Whether building websites or gaming, I’m driven by the same goal: creating memorable experiences that leave a lasting impact.</p>
